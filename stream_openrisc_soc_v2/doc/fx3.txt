FX3 Synchronous slave core
==========================

The FX3 core implements a simple interface for writing to a synchronous slave interface of a Cypress FX3. Most parameters are fixed except for a input flag to signal flow control from the FX3 and data and write enable outputs to the FX3. The internal user interface consists of a 16-bit stream port.

Interfaces

.FX3 Interface
[width="40%",options="header"]
|==========================
|Name    |Width| Dir | Comment
|fd_o    |16   | out | Data to write to FX3
|slwr_n  |1    | out | Active low write enable to FX3
|flagb   |1    | in  | Flow control flag from FX3 to signal busy
|==========================

The FX3 interface should be connected directly to pins interfacing the FX3


.Stream Interface
[width="40%",options="header"]
|==========================
|Name             |Width| Dir | Comment
|stream_s_data_i  |16   | in  | Internal data port
|stream_s_valid_i |1    | in  | Internal data valid
|stream_s_ready_o |1    | out | FX3 core is ready to accept data
|==========================

The Stream interface provides a port for providing data to the FX3 core. A successful transaction of a word occurs when both the valid and ready signals are asserted. This interface is synchronous to clk.
