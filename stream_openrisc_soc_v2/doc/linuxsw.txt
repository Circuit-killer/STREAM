Creating Linux applications
===========================

Installing the musl toolchain
-------------------------------

The Linux toolchain for OpenRISC is built upon the musl C library

Build instructions for the musl toolchain are available link:http://opencores.org/or1k/OpenRISC_GNU_tool_chain#Linux_.28musl.29_toolchain_.28or1k-linux-musl.29[here]

Building applications
---------------------

The basic usage for compiling a C application is +or1k-linux-musl-gcc <program.c>+.



Downloading applications
------------------------

The most common way to add new files to the Linux filesystem is to embed them to the built-in memory filesystem (initramfs).

This is done by copying the binary files to +linux/arch/openrisc/support/initramfs/bin+. If the program uses dynamically linked libraries, ensure that they are also copied to locations where the program can find them (e.g. +linux/arch/openrisc/support/initramfs/lib/+)

After new files are added to the initramfs, the kernel must be rebuilt. Use the following commands to rebuild the kernel.

.Rebuild Linux kernel
-------------
cd linux
export ARCH=openrisc
export CROSS_COMPILE=or1k-elf-
make
-------------

Once the Linux system is running, files can also be copied to the running system via ethernet.
