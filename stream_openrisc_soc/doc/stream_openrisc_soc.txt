Stream OpenRISC SoC
===================

The Stream OpenRISC SoC is a complete System On Chip running on the FPGA on the Stream board. Its main usage is to control all the on-board peripheral devices and to provide a stand-alone platform for SDR applications.

With the supplied Linux image, the SoC is capable of:

* Generating I/Q data in software to send to a MyriadRF board
* Receiving I/Q samples that can be processed with the on-chip OpenRISC CPU or forwaded to the USB3 interface
* Connect to a network with Ethernet
* Handle user I/O with a UART

For special purpose application, the Linux image can be replaced with a light-weight RTOS or a custom bare-metal application to increase performance and real-time capabilities
